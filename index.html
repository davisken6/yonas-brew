                            Founded in 2021, we started as a small batch brewery, brewing at home. Yona's Brew started with our love of dogs and beer. 
                             Yona is a 5 year old pembroke welsh corgi with a heart of gold.
                            At our brewery, all dogs are always welcome. We even have a "beer" for your pup!
                            For every beer we sell, a dollar is donated to the <a href= "https://www.guilfordcountync.gov/our-county/animal-services/animal-shelter/animal-adoption-gallery)">Guilford County Animal Shelter</a>
                            We are happy to announce our new location on Elm Street in downtown Greensboro is officially open!
